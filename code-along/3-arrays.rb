# To run this code, be sure your current working directory
# is the same as where this file is located and then run:
# ruby 3-arrays.rb

# Arrays are lists of things
favorite_foods = ["tacos", "pizza", "ice cream"]
# puts favorite_foods
# p favorite_foods

numbers = [2, 5, 8, 11]
# p numbers

mixed_stuff = ["paper", 23, true]
# p mixed_stuff

# Accessing the array
# puts favorite_foods[0]
# p favorite_foods[3]

# Add to the array
groceries = favorite_foods + ["bananas", "apple juice", "more tacos"]
# puts groceries
more_foods = favorite_foods.push ("avocados")
# p more_foods
# p favorite_foods
# puts favorite_foods.length 

# There are lots of fun things you can do with arrays:
