# To run this code, be sure your current working directory
# is the same as where this file is located and then run:
# ruby 1-data.rb

# In Ruby, there are different *types* of data:

# Numbers
# puts 3
# puts 2
# puts 2 + 3
# puts 246 * 765
# puts 5 / 4
# puts 5 % 4
# puts 5.0 / 4

# Non-numbers
# puts "Hello, world"

# True, False
# puts true
# puts false

# Nothing

# Variables

# x = 3
# y = 5
# puts x
# puts y 
# puts x * y 


# Combine strings and variables
# food = "tacos"  
# # puts food 
# # puts food + " are delicious"
# # puts "#{food} are delicious"
# # puts x + 3
# puts food * 3

# String manipulation
food = "tacos"
puts food.upcase
